# Hazelcast Management Center

Hazelcast Management Center enables you to monitor and manage your cluster members running Hazelcast. In addition to monitoring the overall state of your clusters, you can also analyze and browse your data structures in detail, update map configurations and take thread dumps from members. You can run scripts (JavaScript, Groovy, etc.) and commands on your members with its scripting and console modules.

You can check [Hazelcast IMDG Documentation](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/) and [Management Center Documentation](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/management-center/latest/manual/html/index.html) for more information.

## Quick Start
[Quick Start]: #quick-start

You can launch Hazelcast Management Center by simply running the following command. Please check available 
versions for `$MC_VERSION` on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/hazelcast/management-center/tags).

```
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 hazelcast/management-center:$MC_VERSION
```

Now you can access Hazelcast Management Center from your browser using the URL `http://localhost:8080`. 

If you are running the Docker image in the cloud, you should use a public IP of your machine instead of `localhost`. 

Both `docker ps` and `docker inspect <container-id>` can be used to find `host-ip`. Once you find out `host-ip`, 
you can browse Hazelcast Management Center using the URL: `http://host-ip:8080`.

By default, the container automatically sizes the Java heap memory suitable to the specified resource limit or 
available memory.

## Configuration Options

In Management Center version 5.1 and later, system properties and environment variables
can be used interchangeably. The complete reference of available settings is available in the [Management Center Reference Manual](https://docs.hazelcast.com/management-center/latest/deploy-manage/system-properties). Below you can find example configurations
common in docker environments.

## Example configurations

### Changing the context path

By default, Management Center uses the root context path (`/`) as default. You can override it with the `MC_CONTEXT_PATH`
environment variable.

Example:

```
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 --env MC_CONTEXT_PATH=/hz-mc hazelcast/management-center:$MC_VERSION
```

Management Center will be accessible at `http://host-ip:8080/hz-mc`

_Note: in Management Center 3.x the default context path was `/hazelcast-mancenter`._


### Mounting Management Center Home Directory
[Mounting Management Center Home Directory]: #mounting-management-center-home-directory

Management Center uses the file system to store persistent data. However, that is by default inside the Docker 
container and destroyed in case of container restarts. If you want to store Management Center data externally, 
you need to create a mount to a folder named `/data`. See the following for how to create a mount point. 
`PATH_TO_PERSISTENT_FOLDER` must be replaced by your persistent folder.

```
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -v PATH_TO_PERSISTENT_FOLDER:/data hazelcast/management-center:$MC_VERSION
```

### Setting up a License Key
[Setting up a License Key]: #setting-up-license

To provide a license key, the command line argument you can use the `MC_LICENSE` environment variable:

```
docker run --rm --env MC_LICENSE='<license-key>' -p 8080:8080 hazelcast/management-center:$MC_VERSION
```

### Enabling TLS/SSL
[Enabling TLS/SSL]: #enabling-tlsssl

To enable TLS/SSL, you need to provide the keystore and expose the default port (`8443`):

```
docker run --rm \
         -e JAVA_OPTS='-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.enabled=true \
         -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStore=/keystore/yourkeystore.jks \
         -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStorePassword=yourpassword' \
         -v PATH_TO_KEYSTORE_DIR:/keystore \
         -p 8443:8443 \
         hazelcast/management-center:$MC_VERSION
```

The default port can be changed by overriding the `MC_HTTPS_PORT` environment variable. For example, 
you can run the following command to use port `8444`:

```
docker run --rm -e MC_HTTPS_PORT=8444 \
        -e JAVA_OPTS='-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.enabled=true \
        -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStore=/keystore/yourkeystore.jks \
        -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStorePassword=yourpassword' \
        -v PATH_TO_KEYSTORE_DIR:/keystore \
        -p 8444:8444 \
        hazelcast/management-center:$MC_VERSION
```

Please refer to 
[Management Center Reference Manual](https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/management-center/latest/manual/html/index.html#enabling-tslssl-when-starting-with-jar-file) 
for more information on available options.


### Changing Logging Level
[Changing Logging Level]: #changing-logging-level

The logging level can be changed using the `LOGGING_LEVEL` environment variable. For example, to see the `DEBUG` logs:

```
$ docker run --env LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG hazelcast/management-center:$MC_VERSION
```

Available logging levels are (from highest to lowest): `OFF`, `FATAL`, `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, `TRACE` and `ALL`. 
Invalid levels will be assumed `OFF`.

Note that if you need a more customized logging configuration, you can specify a configuration file.

### Using Custom Log4j Configuration File
[Using Custom Log4j Configuration File]: #using-custom-log4j-configuration-file

Management Center can use your custom Log4j configuration file. You need to create a mount to a folder named 
`/opt/hazelcast/mc_ext`, see the following on how to do it. `PATH_TO_PERSISTENT_FOLDER` must be replaced with 
the path to the folder that your custom Log4j configuration file resides in. `CUSTOM_LOG4J_FILE` must be 
replaced with the name of your custom Log4j configuration file, for example `log4j2-custom.properties`.

```
docker run --env JAVA_OPTS='-Dlog4j.configurationFile=/opt/hazelcast/mc_ext/CUSTOM_LOG4J_FILE' \
           -v PATH_TO_LOCAL_FOLDER:/opt/hazelcast/mc_ext \
           -p 8080:8080 \
           hazelcast/management-center:$MC_VERSION
```

### Starting with an Extra Classpath
[Starting with an Extra Classpath]: #starting-with-an-extra-classpath

You can start Management Center with an extra classpath entry (for example, when using JAAS authentication) 
by using the `MC_CLASSPATH` environment variable:

```
docker run --env MC_CLASSPATH='/path/to/your-extra.jar' -p 8080:8080 hazelcast/management-center:$MC_VERSION
```

### Enabling Health Check Endpoint
[Enabling Health Check Endpoint]: #enabling-health-check-endpoint

When running Management Center, you can enable the Health Check endpoint:

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 \
           --env MC_HEALTH_CHECK_ENABLE=true \
           hazelcast/management-center:$MC_VERSION
```

You can use this endpoint with container orchestraction systems, like Kubernetes. Refer to 
[Management Center Reference Manual](https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/management-center/latest/manual/html/#enabling-health-check-endpoint) 
for more information.

### Customizing Container Setup
[Customizing Container Setup]: #customizing-container-setup

You can make modifications to the container on container startup by defining environment variables.

* `MC_INIT_CMD`: Execute one or more commands separated by semicolons.
* `MC_INIT_SCRIPT`: Execute a script in Bash syntax.
Make this file available by layering to a new container or by assigning a Docker volume.

The commands defined by the variables are executed before starting the Management Center in the listed order.

### Start with a Preconfigured Admin User
[Start with a Preconfigured Admin User]: #start-with-a-preconfigured-admin-user

You can start Management Center with an administrative user by setting the following optional environment variables:

```
docker run --name hazelcast-mc \
         --env MC_ADMIN_USER=admin \
         --env MC_ADMIN_PASSWORD=myPassword11 \
         --rm hazelcast/management-center:$MC_VERSION
```

### Start with a Preconfigured Cluster
[Start with a Preconfigured Cluster]: #start-with-a-preconfigured-cluster

You can start Management Center with a preconfigured cluster by setting the following optional environment variables:

```
docker run --name hazelcast-mc \
         --env MC_DEFAULT_CLUSTER=my-cluster \
         --env MC_DEFAULT_CLUSTER_MEMBERS=192.168.0.10,192.168.0.11 \
         --rm hazelcast/management-center:$MC_VERSION
```

`MC_DEFAULT_CLUSTER_MEMBERS` contains a comma-separated list of the cluster member addresses. `MC_DEFAULT_CLUSTER` contains the cluster
name and defaults to `dev` if not provided.

### JVM Heap Configuration
[JVM Heap Configuration]: #jvm-heap-configuration

By default, the container uses `-XX:+UseContainerSupport -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=80` Java options to automatically size 
the memory available to the JVM. If you don't use the memory resource limit (i.e. `docker run -m 512m ...`, or the 
limit of a Docker orchestration solution like 
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/)), the container might 
use up to 80% percent of the available system memory.

You can define the following variables to change this behavior:

* `CONTAINER_SUPPORT="true"` (default) : use automatic memory resource configuration
* `CONTAINER_SUPPORT="false"` : suppress automatic resource configuration and configure the limits by using the 
following environment variables:
   * `MIN_HEAP_SIZE` : set the minium heap by `-Xms ...` 
   * `MAX_HEAP_SIZE` : set the maximum heap by `-Xmx ...`
   * `JAVA_OPTS` : use a custom configuration like `-Xms64m -Xmn1024m -Xmx2G -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200`

Example:

```
docker run --rm --name hazelcast-mc \
           --env CONTAINER_SUPPORT='false' \
           --env MIN_HEAP_SIZE='512M' \
           --env MAX_HEAP_SIZE='1024M' \
           --env JAVA_OPTS='-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200' \
           hazelcast/management-center:$MC_VERSION
```

## Configuring Management Center Inside Your Custom Docker Image
[Configuring Management Center Inside Your Custom Docker Image]: #configuring-management-center-inside-your-custom-docker-image

You can create a Docker image with `hazelcast/management-center` as the base image and configure it further 
using `hz-mc conf`.

For example:

```
FROM hazelcast/management-center:$MC_VERSION

# Preconfigure cluster connections
ENV MC_DEFAULT_CLUSTER="my-cluster"
ENV MC_DEFAULT_CLUSTER_MEMBERS="192.168.0.10,192.168.0.11"

# Start Management Center
CMD ["bash", "-c", "set -euo pipefail \
      && ./bin/hz-mc conf user create -n admin -r admin -p s3cr3tP@ss \
      && ./bin/hz-mc start \
     "]
```

_Note: if you use Management Center 5.0.x or older, then you have to use `./bin/mc-conf.sh` instead of `./bin/hz-mc conf`._
